# OverEx-Library-Seq

Building a(n eventual nextflow) workflow for analyzing experiments using barseq on over expression plasmids.

## Processess

### Simulated Data for Library Mapping
First steps are to design a plasmid and generate simulated data from that plasmid, as though it were sequenced in ways that would contain both inserts and barcode for eventually mapping the two.
